# low_latency_layer

A C++23 implicit Vulkan layer that reduces click-to-photon latency across three operating modes.

**Transparent mode** activates automatically for any game that does not request `VK_AMD_anti_lag` or `VK_NV_low_latency2`. No configuration is required. Using GPU timestamps injected into every queue submission, the layer waits for the previous frame's GPU work to complete before each present, an Anti-Lag 1 / driver-level pacing strategy that eliminates the pre-rendered frame queue without any cooperation from the game.

**Anti-Lag mode** and **Reflex mode** activate when the game explicitly requests the corresponding extension. By providing hardware-agnostic implementations of `VK_AMD_anti_lag` and `VK_NV_low_latency2`, the layer brings Anti-Lag 2 and Reflex capabilities to AMD and Intel GPUs. When paired with [dxvk-nvapi](https://github.com/jp7677/dxvk-nvapi/) to forward the relevant calls, it bypasses the need for official driver-level support.

The layer also eliminates a hardware support disparity as considerably more applications support NVIDIA's Reflex than AMD's Anti-Lag.

Benchmarks suggest the layer performs as well as or better than the proprietary Windows implementations on the same hardware. [More details and benchmarks are available here.](#testing-and-benchmarks)

# Dependencies

- [CMake](https://cmake.org): A cross-platform, open-source build system generator.

# Building from Source and Installation

Clone this repo.

```
    $ git clone https://github.com/Korthos-Software/low_latency_layer.git
    $ cd low_latency_layer
```

Create an out-of-tree build directory (creatively we'll use 'build') and install.

> ⚠️ **WARNING:** You are likely going to have to install your distro's `vulkan-headers`, `vulkan-utility-libraries`, and possibly even `cmake` packages before proceeding. If you see an error here their absence is almost certainly the reason.

```
    $ cmake -B build && cmake --build build -j$(nproc) && sudo cmake --install build
```

# Usage and Configuration

The layer operates in one of three modes, selected based on the extensions the game requests at device creation:

- **Transparent mode**: opt-in via `LOW_LATENCY_LAYER_TRANSPARENT=1` for games that do not request either extension. Injects GPU timestamps into every submission and paces frame delivery to the GPU's actual frame time, draining the pre-render queue without stalling the GPU pipeline. Only beneficial when the GPU has headroom; has no effect at 100% GPU utilization.
- **Anti-Lag mode**: active when the game requests `VK_AMD_anti_lag`. For Linux-native applications like *Counter-Strike 2* this works out-of-the-box, allowing you to toggle AMD's Anti-Lag in its menus.
- **Reflex mode**: active when `LOW_LATENCY_LAYER_REFLEX=1` is set and the game requests `VK_NV_low_latency2`. Required for Proton titles that use NVIDIA Reflex.

You can further customize the layer's behavior using the environment variables listed below.

| Variable | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `LOW_LATENCY_LAYER_REFLEX` | Set to `1` to expose `VK_NV_low_latency2` instead of `VK_AMD_anti_lag`. |
| `LOW_LATENCY_LAYER_TRANSPARENT` | Set to `1` to enable transparent mode for games with no anti-lag support. Paces CPU frame submission to the GPU's measured frame time. Only effective when the GPU is not already at 100% utilization. |
| `LOW_LATENCY_LAYER_FORCE_DECOUPLED` | Set to `1` to force mitigation of a decoupled simulation and render queue. This is disabled by default - only enabled for Marvel Rivals. Refer to `delay_controller.hh` for more details. Do not use outside of debugging - this will hurt latency in most applications. |
| `LOW_LATENCY_LAYER_SPOOF_NVIDIA` | Set to `1` to report the device as an NVIDIA GPU to the application, regardless of actual hardware. Not recommended - prefer `DXVK_CONFIG="dxgi.hideAmdGpu = True"`, as this option is known to break Proton's FSR4 upgrade path. |
| `DISABLE_LOW_LATENCY_LAYER` | Expose to disable the layer. |


For Proton-based applications, try `LOW_LATENCY_LAYER_REFLEX=1` on its own first. If the Reflex option does not appear in-game, add `DXVK_CONFIG="dxgi.hideAmdGpu = True"`. Avoid `PROTON_FORCE_NVAPI=1` and `LOW_LATENCY_LAYER_SPOOF_NVIDIA=1` - both are known to break Proton's FSR4 upgrade path (`PROTON_FSR4_UPGRADE` / `PROTON_FSR4_RDNA3_UPGRADE`).

**Steam launch options example:**
```
DXVK_CONFIG="dxgi.hideAmdGpu = True" LOW_LATENCY_LAYER_REFLEX=1 %command%
```

The 'Boost' mode of Reflex is supported but is functionally identical to 'On' - the layer treats both modes identically.

# Testing and Benchmarks

Benchmarks were conducted under worst-case conditions using high-end AMD hardware. For configurations that create higher GPU load, these latency reductions will be more pronounced. We preferred testing on low resolution and high refresh-rate monitors as they provide less variance and are more likely to reveal correctness issues against proprietary reference implementations.

## Setup and Methodology

[testing.webm](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b97efee4-8c1f-4cde-acdf-676a2c283d3d)

*   **GPU:** ASUS TUF Radeon RX 7900 XTX (flashed 550W Aqua Extreme BIOS) 1250MHz VRAM watercooled
*   **CPU:** AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D 102.0MHz eCLK -15 CO 2133MHz FCLK delid watercooled
*   **Memory:** 64GB 2x32GB Hynix A-Die 6000MT/s CL28-36-36-30 GDM:off Nitro:1-2-0 (tuned)

We used Gentoo running KDE Plasma 6.6. Direct scanout was enabled throughout the testing process, verified as KWin’s 'Compositing' watermark disappeared when in fullscreen. Latency was measured using the NVIDIA Reflex Analyzer integrated into the ASUS PG248QP.

## THE FINALS
![tf](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nJ3ahxac/files/main/low_latency_layer/the_finals.png)
**Comments**

- We included comparisons against AMD's proprietary DX12 implementation of Anti-Lag 2 on Windows. The results suggest latency matches or beats native Windows numbers.
- We can directly compare our implementation of Reflex and Anti-Lag technologies - they appear to perform identically as both are in line with AMD's proprietary reference implementation of Anti-Lag 2.
- Mesa's anti-lag Vulkan layer was also included in testing. It appears to be a no-op in this case as it provides no latency benefit. The data suggests it may even increase latency slightly.

## Counter-Strike 2
![cs2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nJ3ahxac/files/main/low_latency_layer/cs2.png)
**Comments**

- Unlike THE FINALS, where results were comparable, both technology implementations clearly beat the native Windows numbers in absolute terms.
- Reflex and Anti-Lag 2 again perform identically, consistent with our previous findings.
- CS2's `-vulkan` backend was also tested on Windows. It regresses baseline latency relative to the default backend, and AMD's Anti-Lag 2 does not recover this - it remains slower than Anti-Lag 2 on the default backend.
- Mesa's Anti-Lag Vulkan layer again appears to be a no-op, matching our findings from THE FINALS.

## Cyberpunk 2077
![cyberpunk](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nJ3ahxac/files/main/low_latency_layer/cyberpunk.png)
**Comments**

- Cyberpunk is an interesting test case: Anti-Lag 2 on Linux appears broken (suspected cause is an application bug). The layer never observes a call to `AntiLagUpdateAMD`, which is required to function. The settings UI also lacks an explicit Anti-Lag 2 toggle. To complicate things further, Anti-Lag 2 is enabled by default on Windows.
- On Windows, Anti-Lag 2 can be disabled by holding right ctrl with the debug overlay open (shift+alt+f).
- Despite no Linux Anti-Lag implementation working correctly, our Reflex path still exceeds native Windows Anti-Lag 2 in absolute latency. Naturally, this path should be preferred for this application.

## Resident Evil Requiem
![re9](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nJ3ahxac/files/main/low_latency_layer/re9.png)
**Comments**

- Resident Evil Requiem doesn't support Anti-Lag 2 but does support Reflex. We compare the closest Windows alternative for AMD users - Anti-Lag 1 - to our 'native' Reflex support.
- Anti-Lag 1 on Windows performed similarly to the native Linux baseline.
- Our Reflex implementation outperformed every other tested method in absolute latency.

## Marvel Rivals
![marvel_rivals](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nJ3ahxac/files/main/low_latency_layer/marvel_rivals.png)
**Comments**

- Marvel Rivals was a pain point during development. It has a decoupled simulation and render queue and required some careful statistics and additional delays (see `delay_controller.hh`) to match the Windows implementation.
- I believe that the use of Reflex/Anti-Lag while providing a decoupled simulation and render queue should be considered an application bug. Marvel Rivals would achieve significantly greater latency reductions if the developers tightly coupled their simulation and render pipelines. This would make our statistics-based approach unnecessary. This is likely a single configuration option in UE5.
- This additional delay approach is enabled by default for this application only, but can be forced on with `LOW_LATENCY_LAYER_FORCE_DECOUPLED=1`.

## Overwatch 2
![overwatch2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nJ3ahxac/files/main/low_latency_layer/overwatch2.png)

- Overwatch 2 lets us test at 4K without Gamescope latency overhead. As the GPU becomes a greater bottleneck here, the result is more representative of weaker hardware running at lower resolutions.
- Like Resident Evil Requiem, Overwatch 2 supports Reflex but not Anti-Lag 2, so we again compare against Anti-Lag 1 as the closest Windows alternative for AMD users.
- Anti-Lag 1 on Windows tracked the native Linux baseline closely, offering little benefit.
- Our Reflex path performed well, comfortably ahead of the other tested configurations.
